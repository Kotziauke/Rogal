# About the game

  Rogal is a simple game focused around exploring and collecting.
  
  On your play, you will deal with labirynth-like mazes where the
  objective is to collect every single coin in order to proceed to
  the next level.
  
  The game ends, when you clear all the stages...
  
  ...But worry not! You can create your own maps and share them with
  others to extend your playthrough.



# Controls

  In main menu, press P to start the game or Q to quit to the shell.
  
  In game, use WASD keys to walk. Pressing E will exit current level
  and send you back to the main menu.



# Map list

  Map list is a text file that contains a map sequence, it must be
  called "List.txt" and placed in the same directory as the game
  binary.
  
  This file must contain relative paths to map files, written in
  separate lines. At least one map is required for the game to accept
  such a list.



# Map format

  Maps are binary files, they contain a header and level data.


  * Header

    Header contains a four byte signature, noted in hexadecimal as:
    4D 41 50 01 (which stands for an ASCII string "MAP" followed by
    a format version).


  * Level data

    Level data is a sequence of map elements. Every element starts
    with an identifier followed by two or four bytes of information,
    depending on the element type:

    - Room:
      Offset: Length: Description:
      0       1       ASCII letter 'R'.
      1       1       X position of the room.
      2       1       Y position of the room.
      3       1       Width of the room.
      4       1       Height of the room.
      Note: Width and height of the room must be greater than zero.

      2       1       Y position of the hallway.
      3       1       Width of the hallway.
      4       1       Height of the hallway.
      Note: Width and height of the hallway must be greater than zero.

    - Coin:

      2       1       Y position of the coin.

      inside a walkable areas. Two coins cannot be placed in the same
      spot.

      1       1       X position of the start point.
      2       1       Y position of the start point.
      Note: Map must include exactly one start point which must be
